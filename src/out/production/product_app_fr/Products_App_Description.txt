======================PRODUCTS APP=============================================

Develop an application that manages a stock of products (TVs).

The application will read and write products to a CSV file like bellow:
Sample “products” file

code, brand, diagonal_size, width, height, display_technology, price, quantity
1, Samsung, 30, 145.1, 80, LED, 234.23, 4
2, Samsung, 28, 145.2, 80, LCD, 232.23, 1

Note. The file will display, on the first row, the comma separated field definitions of a product and on the following rows will display the values of each product (each product is defined in a row)

TODOs:
1. Display a list with all the products from the file (display each field of the product like in example bellow):
(1) Samsung (LED) 30" - 234.23$ (w:h: 145.1cm, 80cm) -> 4 in stock
(2) Samsung (LCD) 30" - 234.23$ (w:h: 145.1cm, 80cm) -> 1 in stock
...

2. User can search products by code or brand. He will enter, in the console, a code or brand name and after he hits Enter, the console
will print the list of products that match the search criteria (list will be displayed as in TODO #1)

3. Add a new product. User will be prompted in the console to enter a value for each field and at the end (after he entered a value
for display_technology, he will have two options: 1 - submit 2 - cancel. On submit, the new product will be saved in the products file.
If the user choose 2 (cancel) the action will be discarded.

4. Allow sorting. User will have 3 options:
	a. by brand
	b. by diagonal size
	c. by price
	
5. Buy a TV - user will be propted to enter the code of the TV he wants to buy then will have two options 1 - buy 2 - cancel
If he chooses 1: The product will be added to a "orders" CSV file (same structure as the one for products with one new field: order_date).
Also, that product's quantity must be updated in the "products" file.
